Introduction
===============

Background
------------
The goal of the Testsmart project is to improve antimalarial stewardship in the private retail sector,
which has the largest market share of anti-malarials in sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, we are testing
a policy-relevant strategy that targets antimalarial subsidies in the retail sector to confirmed malaria 
cases by offering diagnosis-dependent subsidies for mRDT, Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test (for Malaria Testing) 
and ACT, Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy ( for malaria treatment). The study has 2 aims. In Aim 1, 
we consider a scenario where a set amount of public funds is earmarked to provide subsidized malaria commodities
in the private retail sector and explore how those funds should be allocated between subsidies for testing versus
subsidies for treatment using an individually – randomized experiment. The goal is to identify the combination 
of mRDT subsidy-level and conditional ACT subsidy level that maximizes uptake of diagnostic testing. In Aim 2,
we will scale-up the subsidy combination identified in Aim 1 in Kenya and Nigeria. Using a randomized controlled
trial design in which we randomize shops, we will evaluate the impact of the package on a range of outcomes.
We will demonstrate the impact of the subsidy package on targeting of ACTs and the cost savings associated
with diagnosis-dependent subsidies in these two countries with contrasting public health policies governing
malaria case management. By selecting two settings that differ in urbanization, malaria endemicity and median 
household income, we hope to show that this approach is not only scalable within but also across endemic countries
where a significant proportion of fever cases seek care in the private sector.

Summarry of Business Problem
-----------------------------

• Access and convenience lead patients to seek care outside the public sector – where poor quality diagnostics and treatment are common. Up to 66% of fever cases seek care in the private sector, thus making the private sector a critical player in Malaria case management
• Weak systems of accountability and oversight complicate efforts to regulate and track private sector-based case 
  management encounters
• The private sector is underrepresented in national health management information systems used for malaria surveillance,especially the retail private sector.
